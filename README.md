This assignment covered a few different aspects of website making and managing that I had never done before, I have used HTML and CSS before but I have never used CMD beyond getting my IPV4 for port forwarding to run gaming servers for friends. I have also never made implemented images into any sort of formatting other than getting their size right and position.
The first challenge for me was getting used to command prompt. This is because you need to be accurate and one mistake can cause a lot of problems, I found this when trying to make a directory and spelling the name wrong and then not being able to get into it using the name that I thought I’d given it, this only required me to look up the directories that were available however this did cause me to slow down when I was using it adding to the time it took to complete it.
Another challenge that I faced was in the arranging of the images, as I said I haven’t done this type of organisation before so had to look up how to do it. W3 schools gave me a lot of help with this as it is where I always go when I am struggling with code, this gave me the knowledge of what the code needed to be but with their examples that they provide it allowed me to go through it can change each part to see what parts affected what in the final image so that I could get a more complete understanding of the code and what it all really meant.
The aspects of the work that are correctly implemented are the format of the images and the form, these were both new things for me however they were both easy enough to do once I had looked them both up on W3 schools and worked with the HTML for a bit.
The biggest struggle for me was using the command prompt, the HTML and CSS is something I have done a lot in the past, making websites for my scout group and a few as jokes for friends. Using git was a new thing for me and I struggled a lot with it, getting a live link was something I struggled with, however this was because I wasn’t looking In the right place and now that I know how to use it I can see myself using github to look after my code in the furture.
